## About

I am a second-year graduate student at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.math.upenn.edu/), and my research advisor is [Angela Gibney](https://www.angelagibney.org). I am primarily interested in mathematical physics, particularly in vertex operator algebras and moduli spaces of varieties. I received my undergraduate degree at Purdue University in Mathematics and Physics. You can find my CV [here](/assets/CV.pdf).
